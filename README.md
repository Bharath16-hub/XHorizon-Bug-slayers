RePlate – AI Powered Geo-Intelligent Food Donation & Rescue System
RePlate is a smart and scalable food donation platform designed to minimize food waste and hunger using AI and geo-intelligence. It connects food donors (restaurants, individuals), NGOs, and volunteers in real-time to ensure excess food is safely and efficiently redistributed to people in need.
Every year, millions of tons of edible food go to waste, while many people suffer from hunger. Traditional food donation systems lack efficiency, transparency, and real-time coordination. RePlate solves this by leveraging geolocation, AI, and real-time tracking to automate and optimize food collection and distribution.
